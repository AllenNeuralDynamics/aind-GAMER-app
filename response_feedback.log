2025-01-23 14:08:31,295 - Query: What are the modalities that exist in the database? What are the least and most common ones?
2025-01-23 14:08:57,832 - Response: Based on the query results, I can provide you with information about the modalities that exist in the database and their relative frequencies. Here's a summary of the modalities from most common to least common:

<start>
Behavior: 18951
Behavior videos: 10333
Selective plane illumination microscopy: 4470
Extracellular electrophysiology: 4192
Fiber photometry: 3732
Planar optical physiology: 1179
Hyperspectral fiber photometry: 105
Optical physiology: 40
Trained behavior: 28
Electromyography: 10
Electrophysiology: 9
Dual inverted selective plane illumination microscopy: 6
</end>

To answer your specific questions:

1. The modalities that exist in the database are:
   - Behavior
   - Behavior videos
   - Selective plane illumination microscopy
   - Extracellular electrophysiology
   - Fiber photometry
   - Planar optical physiology
   - Hyperspectral fiber photometry
   - Optical physiology
   - Trained behavior
   - Electromyography
   - Electrophysiology
   - Dual inverted selective plane illumination microscopy

2. The most common modality is Behavior, with 18,951 instances.

3. The least common modality is Dual inverted selective plane illumination microscopy, with only 6 instances.

It's worth noting that there's a significant range in the frequency of these modalities, with the top few (Behavior, Behavior videos, Selective plane illumination microscopy, Extracellular electrophysiology, and Fiber photometry) being much more common than the others.

2025-01-23 14:10:39,318 - Query: What is the MongoDB query to find the injections used in SmartSPIM_675387_2023-05-23_23-05-56
2025-01-23 14:11:07,385 - Response: Based on the MongoDB query results, I can provide you with information about the injections used in the experiment "SmartSPIM_675387_2023-05-23_23-05-56". Here's a summary of the injections:

1. First Injection:
   - Material: AAVrg-Syn-H2B-Turquoise (Virus)
   - Lot Number: 221111-22
   - Titer: 48,000,000,000,000 gc/mL
   - Targeted Structure: Isocortex
   - Injection Volume: 50.0 nanoliters

2. Second Injection:
   - Material: AAVrg-Syn-H2B-tdTomato (Virus)
   - Lot Number: 221111-23
   - Titer: 51,000,000,000,000 gc/mL
   - Targeted Structure: Isocortex
   - Injection Volume: 50 nanoliters

Both injections were performed using the Nanoject injection procedure and targeted the Isocortex. The volumes injected were the same (50 nanoliters) for both viruses, but the titers were slightly different.

The MongoDB query used to retrieve this information was:

```javascript
[
  { $match: { name: "SmartSPIM_675387_2023-05-23_23-05-56" } },
  { $project: { "procedures.subject_procedures": 1 } },
  { $unwind: "$procedures.subject_procedures" },
  { $unwind: "$procedures.subject_procedures.procedures" },
  { $match: { "procedures.subject_procedures.procedures.procedure_type": "Nanoject injection" } },
  { $project: {
      injection_materials: "$procedures.subject_procedures.procedures.injection_materials",
      targeted_structure: "$procedures.subject_procedures.procedures.targeted_structure",
      injection_volume: "$procedures.subject_procedures.procedures.injection_volume",
      injection_volume_unit: "$procedures.subject_procedures.procedures.injection_volume_unit"
    }
  }
]
```

This query first matches the specific experiment by name, then navigates through the nested structure to find the Nanoject injection procedures, and finally projects the relevant injection details.
